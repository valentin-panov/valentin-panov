Welcome to my GH collection. I'm in web development since 2020.

I work as an architect in the internal medical information system (based on Java) since 2010 for Sokolov Scientific and Clinical Center, Saint-Petersburg, Russia (www.med122.com).

Have experience in UI development. Now I do my postgrad work in my Uni https://netology.ru/ and contribute to educational platform Math1.0 https://github.com/spirit-drive/education-raw

I am open for internship/part-time offers.
